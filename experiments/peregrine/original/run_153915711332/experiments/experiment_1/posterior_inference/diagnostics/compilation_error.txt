CMDSTAN COMPILATION ERROR
=========================

Date: 2025-10-29
Environment: Docker container without build tools

Error Summary:
--------------
CmdStanPy is installed and CmdStan binaries are present, but the build toolchain is not available:
- No 'make' command
- No C++ compiler (g++, gcc, clang)
- Cannot compile .stan files to executables

Attempted Solutions:
--------------------
1. CmdStanModel.compile() - Failed: make command not found
2. Manual stanc compilation - SUCCESS: Generated .hpp file
3. Manual C++ compilation - Failed: No C++ compiler
4. PyMC fallback - Failed: PyMC not installed
5. NumPyro fallback - Failed: NumPyro not installed
6. emcee fallback - Failed: emcee not installed

Available Tools:
----------------
- CmdStanPy 1.3.0 (library only, cannot compile)
- stanc (Stan→C++ translator) - Working
- ArviZ (for diagnostics)
- NumPy, SciPy, pandas

Status:
-------
Cannot run HMC/NUTS sampling without either:
  A) Working C++ compiler and make (for CmdStan)
  B) Pure Python PPL (PyMC, NumPyro, emcee)

Recommendation:
---------------
This environment lacks the required PPL infrastructure for Bayesian MCMC.
Need to either:
1. Install build tools (make, g++) in container
2. Install PyMC or NumPyro
3. Use a different execution environment

The Stan model itself is valid (syntax checked successfully).
