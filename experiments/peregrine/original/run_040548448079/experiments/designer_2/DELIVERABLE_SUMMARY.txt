✓ Pre-registered predictions (before fitting)
✓ Adversarial testing (designed to break models)
✓ Clear stopping rules (ΔLOO < -20 → reject smooth models)
✓ Honest assessment (expect models to fail)

TECHNICAL COMPLETENESS:
✓ Full mathematical specifications
✓ Prior justifications from EDA
✓ Complete Stan code
✓ Complete PyMC code
✓ Diagnostic procedures
✓ Model comparison framework

PRACTICAL USABILITY:
✓ Step-by-step implementation guide
✓ Expected timeline (~14 hours)
✓ Troubleshooting tips
✓ Multiple reading paths

================================================================================
EXPECTED OUTCOME (HONEST PREDICTION)
================================================================================

PRIMARY PREDICTION (75% confidence):
→ Smooth models FAIL
→ Discrete structural break at observation 17 confirmed
→ Recommendation: Use Designer 1's changepoint models

EVIDENCE THAT WOULD SUPPORT THIS:
- All smooth models LOO-ELPD > 20 worse than changepoint
- GP lengthscale < 0.2 (trying to capture discontinuity)
- First derivative discontinuous at observation 17
- Leave-future-out CV: smooth models RMSE > 2× changepoint

ALTERNATIVE (25% confidence):
→ Smooth models competitive
→ Smooth acceleration sufficient
→ Recommendation: Use GP or Spline

================================================================================
DECISION CRITERIA
================================================================================

ΔLOO (Smooth vs Changepoint) | Interpretation
-----------------------------|------------------
> -10                        | Smooth sufficient
-10 to -20                   | Borderline
< -20                        | Discrete break real ← EXPECTED

Additional red flags:
- GP lengthscale < 0.2
- First derivative jump > 1.0
- Residual ACF(1) > 0.5
- Prior-posterior conflict

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP
================================================================================

Phase 1: Polynomial (2-3 hours)
  → Fit baseline model
  → Check diagnostics
  → Establish benchmark

Phase 2: GP (4-6 hours)
  → Fit most flexible model
  → Check lengthscale behavior
  → Test for discontinuity

Phase 3: Spline (3-4 hours)
  → Fit semi-parametric model
  → Test knot sensitivity
  → Check derivative

Phase 4: Comparison (2-3 hours)
  → LOO-ELPD comparison
  → Residual analysis
  → First derivative tests

Phase 5: Decision (1-2 hours)
  → Compare to Designer 1
  → Apply decision rules
  → Document outcome

TOTAL: ~14 hours

UNIQUE CONTRIBUTIONS
================================================================================

1. FALSIFICATION-FIRST DESIGN
   - Each model includes: "I will abandon this if..."
   - Not just success criteria, but failure criteria
   - Designed to fail if wrong (not force to work)

2. PRE-REGISTERED PREDICTIONS
   - Expected LOO values documented before fitting
   - Expected parameter ranges specified
   - Prevents post-hoc rationalization
   - "What would change our mind?" documented

3. ADVERSARIAL TESTING
   - Synthetic data test (should fail on wrong DGP)
   - Leave-future-out CV (extrapolation stress test)
   - First derivative discontinuity check
   - Designed to break models, not confirm them

4. HONEST ASSESSMENT
   - "I expect these models to fail" stated upfront
   - Success = correctly identifying when models fail
   - Scientific value even if models don't work

================================================================================
COMPARISON TO DESIGNER 1
================================================================================

Designer 1 (Changepoint):
- Assumes discrete regime change
- Two-regime models
- Expected to be best

Designer 2 (Smooth):
- Assumes continuous acceleration
- Flexible smooth functions
- Expected to fail (falsification test)

COMPLEMENTARITY:
- Designer 1: Primary hypothesis
- Designer 2: Falsification test
- Together: Comprehensive evaluation

================================================================================
SUCCESS METRICS

TRADITIONAL: Model fits well → Success
OUR APPROACH: Truth discovered → Success

Success cases:
✓ Smooth models work → Found simpler explanation

FINAL NOTES
================================================================================

PHILOSOPHY:
"The goal is finding truth, not completing tasks."

EXPECTATION:
Smooth models will likely fail. That's scientific success.

COMMITMENT:
Will accept discrete break if evidence demands it.
Will not force smooth models to work.

VALUE:
Even if models fail, systematic falsification has value:
- Rules out smooth alternatives
- Confirms discrete break is robust
- Demonstrates intellectual honesty
- Shows what evidence supports changepoint models
