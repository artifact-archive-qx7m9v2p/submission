================================================================================
USAGE RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

✓ RECOMMENDED FOR:

  1. Scientific Inference
     - Report β = 0.314 ± 0.033 as main finding
     - Communicate logarithmic (diminishing returns) pattern
     - Use 95% CI [0.256, 0.386] for uncertainty

  2. Predictions Within Data Range (x ∈ [1, 32])
     - Use posterior predictive distribution
     - Report with 90% credible intervals (conservative)
     - Interpolation fully supported

  3. Effect Size Communication
     - "Doubling x increases Y by ~0.22 units"
     - "10-fold increase in x increases Y by ~0.72 units"
     - "Logarithmic relationship with diminishing returns"

  4. Publications
     - Model validated through comprehensive Bayesian workflow
     - All diagnostics support scientific claims
     - Include performance_summary.png as main figure

⚠️ USE WITH CAUTION:

  1. Moderate Extrapolation
     - Can extend to x ∈ [0.5, 40] with increased uncertainty
     - Clearly communicate extrapolation caveats
     - Consider functional form validity beyond data range

  2. High-Precision Applications
     - n=27 provides modest precision (β: CV=0.10)
     - Consider additional data if tighter bounds needed
     - Current precision adequate for most scientific claims

❌ NOT RECOMMENDED:

  1. Extreme Extrapolation
     - Do not use for x > 50 or x < 0.5
     - Functional form may not hold outside observed range
     - Requires additional validation

  2. Non-Independent Data
     - Model assumes independent observations
     - Not suitable for time series, spatial, or hierarchical data
     - Consider appropriate extensions if structure present

================================================================================
LIMITATIONS AND CAVEATS
================================================================================

1. Sample Size (n=27)
   - Limits precision, especially for nuisance parameters
   - Scientific parameters adequately constrained
   - Consider additional data for higher precision

2. Interpolation Only
   - Validated for x ∈ [1, 32]
   - Extrapolation requires caution
   - Logarithmic form may not hold indefinitely

3. Functional Form
   - Logarithmic relationship assumed
   - Alternatives not exhaustively tested
   - Model comparison supports this choice vs change-point

4. Homoscedasticity
   - Assumes constant variance across x
   - Slight heteroscedasticity visible but acceptable
   - Monitor if extended to larger datasets

5. Independence
   - Assumes independent observations
   - Verify data collection supports this
   - Use hierarchical models if grouping present

6. Weak Nuisance Parameters
   - c and ν have high uncertainty (expected)
   - Don't over-interpret precise values
   - They improve fit without overfitting

================================================================================
COMPARISON TO MODEL 2 (REFERENCE)
================================================================================

Model 1 (Logarithmic) vs Model 2 (Change-Point):

ELPD Difference:     +3.31 ± 3.35 (Model 1 better)
Interpretation:      Modest but consistent advantage
p_LOO:              2.61 vs 4.56 (Model 1 simpler)
Pareto k:           All excellent vs some good (Model 1 more reliable)

Winner: Model 1 (Logarithmic)
Reason: Better predictive performance with lower complexity

Model 2 rejected due to:
- Lower ELPD (though not by large margin)
- Higher effective complexity (more parameters needed)
- Less parsimonious explanation

Model 1 accepted due to:
- Higher ELPD (better predictions)
- Lower complexity (simpler explanation)
- Excellent LOO reliability (all Pareto k < 0.5)
