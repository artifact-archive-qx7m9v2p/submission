DESIGNER 3: ROBUST MODELS AND ALTERNATIVE SPECIFICATIONS
================================================================================

CORE QUESTION: Do we need robustness at all for the Eight Schools dataset?

EDA CONTEXT:
- NO outliers detected (all |z| < 2)
- NO heterogeneity (Q p=0.696, I²=0%, tau²=0)
- Strong evidence for complete pooling
- Measurement uncertainty dominates signal

DESIGN PHILOSOPHY:
Testing whether robustness is NECESSARY, not assuming it is.
If robust models converge to normal → VALIDATES normal assumptions.
If robust models differ → REVEALS hidden issues EDA missed.

================================================================================
THREE MODEL CLASSES PROPOSED
================================================================================

1. STUDENT-T MODELS (Heavy-Tailed Alternatives)
   ├─ Model 1A: Student-t data distribution
   ├─ Model 1B: Student-t random effects
   └─ Model 1C: Double Student-t (maximum robustness)

   Falsification: If nu_posterior > 30 → abandon, use normal
   Expected: nu ≈ 20-40 (converge to normal)

2. MIXTURE MODELS (Outlier Detection)
   ├─ Model 2A: Outlier indicator model (variance inflation)
   ├─ Model 2B: Latent class model (two subgroups)
   └─ Model 2C: Dirichlet process (fully nonparametric)

   Falsification: If K=1 cluster → abandon, use simple hierarchical
   Expected: All p_i < 0.2, no outliers detected

3. PRIOR SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
   └─ Grid search: 6 mu priors × 6 tau priors = 36 models

   Metric: Relative_Sensitivity = (max - min) / posterior_SD
   Threshold: < 0.5 is robust, > 1.0 is sensitive
   Expected: Rel_Sens < 0.5 (data dominate priors)

================================================================================
EXPECTED OUTCOMES (PROBABILISTIC PREDICTIONS)
================================================================================

MOST LIKELY (85%): Robustness NOT needed
├─ nu_posterior > 30 (Student-t → normal)
├─ All p_i < 0.2 (no outliers)
├─ Relative_Sensitivity < 0.5 (low prior dependence)
└─ CONCLUSION: Normal hierarchical model appropriate
   ACTION: Report robustness checks as validation

POSSIBLE (10%): Mild robustness benefits
├─ nu_posterior = 10-30 (borderline heavy tails)
├─ Some p_i = 0.2-0.5 (uncertain outliers)
├─ Relative_Sensitivity = 0.5-1.0 (moderate dependence)
└─ CONCLUSION: Report range, use conservative priors
   ACTION: Sensitivity analysis in supplement

UNLIKELY (5%): Strong robustness needed
├─ nu_posterior < 10 (very heavy tails)
├─ Some p_i > 0.7 (clear outliers)
├─ Relative_Sensitivity > 1.0 (high dependence)
└─ CONCLUSION: EDA missed something important
   ACTION: Investigate cause, report robust model

================================================================================
IMPLEMENTATION ROADMAP (PRIORITY ORDER)
================================================================================

PHASE 1: Baseline (30 min) - ALWAYS DO
├─ Fit normal hierarchical model
├─ Posterior predictive checks
├─ Establish LOO-CV baseline
└─ CHECKPOINT: If R-hat > 1.05 → STOP, reconsider structure

PHASE 2: Core Robustness (45 min) - ALWAYS DO
├─ Fit Student-t model (1A)
├─ Fit outlier indicator model (2A)
├─ Compare LOO-CV to baseline
└─ CHECKPOINT: If nu > 30 AND p_i < 0.2 → SKIP Phase 3

PHASE 3: Extended Robustness (60 min) - CONDITIONAL
├─ Fit Student-t variants (1B, 1C)
├─ Fit latent class model (2B)
└─ CONDITION: Only if Phase 2 found evidence for robustness

PHASE 4: Prior Sensitivity (45 min) - ALWAYS DO
├─ Fit 36 model combinations (parallelized)
├─ Compute sensitivity metrics
├─ Generate heatmaps
└─ CHECKPOINT: If Rel_Sens > 1.0 → Report as high sensitivity

PHASE 5: Synthesis (30 min) - ALWAYS DO
├─ Model comparison table
├─ Visualization suite
└─ Final report with recommendations

TOTAL TIME: 2-3 hours (parallelized)

================================================================================
KEY FALSIFICATION CRITERIA (WHEN TO ABANDON MODELS)
================================================================================

ABANDON STUDENT-T IF:
✗ Posterior nu > 30 with 95% CI > 20
✗ No improvement in LOO-CV (< 2 points)
✗ Computational issues (divergences, poor mixing)
✗ High correlation between nu and tau (non-identifiability)

ABANDON MIXTURE MODELS IF:
✗ Posterior favors K=1 cluster (probability > 0.9)
✗ Label switching prevents inference
✗ WAIC/LOO worse than simple model (> 5 penalty)
✗ Outlier assignments are arbitrary (all p_i ≈ 0.5)

REPORT HIGH PRIOR SENSITIVITY IF:
✗ Relative_Sensitivity > 1.0 for mu or tau
✗ Different priors give contradictory conclusions
✗ Prior-data conflict (posterior far from both)

ABANDON ALL MODELS IF (FUNDAMENTAL RED FLAGS):
✗ Prior-posterior conflict across ALL model classes
✗ Extreme parameter values (tau > 50, nu < 3)
✗ Computational breakdown in simple models
✗ Posterior predictive checks fail universally
✗ Inconsistent results across independent designers

UNIQUE CONTRIBUTIONS (vs OTHER DESIGNERS)
================================================================================

Designer 3's Focus:
├─ Systematic distributional robustness
├─ Quantitative sensitivity metrics
├─ Decision thresholds and falsification criteria
├─ Critical perspective: "Is robustness even needed?"
└─ Adversarial testing of assumptions

Expected Overlap:
├─ All designers: hierarchical models
├─ Some designers: Student-t alternatives
└─ Most designers: prior sensitivity

Value of Multiple Designers:
├─ If converge → strong evidence for conclusions
├─ If diverge → reveals genuine uncertainty
└─ Either outcome is scientifically valuable

QUICK REFERENCE: INTERPRETATION THRESHOLDS
================================================================================

STUDENT-T DEGREES OF FREEDOM (nu):
  > 30    : Effectively normal → use normal model
  10-30   : Borderline heavy tails → report sensitivity
  < 10    : Strong evidence for heavy tails → use robust model

OUTLIER PROBABILITY (p_i):
  < 0.2   : Not an outlier → standard analysis
  0.2-0.7 : Uncertain → investigate
  > 0.7   : Likely outlier → validate, consider removal

PRIOR SENSITIVITY (Relative_Sensitivity):
  < 0.5   : Low sensitivity → robust to priors
  0.5-1.0 : Moderate sensitivity → report range
  > 1.0   : High sensitivity → need more data or informative prior

LOO-CV DIFFERENCE (vs baseline):
  < 1     : Negligible → stick with simpler model
  1-3     : Modest → report as sensitivity
  > 3     : Substantial → consider robust model

INTEGRATION WITH OTHER DESIGNERS
================================================================================

PARALLEL DESIGN STRUCTURE:
├─ Designer 1: [Unknown focus - likely standard hierarchical variants]
├─ Designer 2: [Unknown focus - likely alternative model classes]
└─ Designer 3: Robust models and sensitivity (THIS DESIGN)

SYNTHESIS APPROACH:
1. Compare model classes proposed by all designers
2. Identify overlap (validate consensus)
3. Focus on disagreements (investigate causes)
4. Use robustness to test if distributional assumptions explain differences

IF ALL AGREE:
└─ Report consensus + robustness validation

IF WE DISAGREE:
└─ Investigate if disagreement is due to:
   ├─ Distributional assumptions (Student-t vs Normal)
   ├─ Prior choices (sensitivity analysis reveals)
   └─ Model structure (fundamentally different approaches)

EITHER OUTCOME IS VALUABLE:
├─ Agreement → strong evidence
└─ Disagreement → honest uncertainty, guide future research

================================================================================
CORE PHILOSOPHY (FINAL STATEMENT)
================================================================================

"The goal is NOT to prove robustness is needed.
 The goal is to TEST whether assumptions matter.

 If robust models converge to normal models,
 that is EVIDENCE that normality is appropriate.

 Negative results (robustness not needed) are
 just as valuable as positive results (robustness matters).

 Success = Learning whether assumptions matter,
 not always preferring complex models.

 Parsimony is a virtue when it's justified."

================================================================================

STATUS: DESIGN COMPLETE - READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION

Next Steps:
1. Await main agent signal to begin implementation
2. Coordinate with other designers on shared models
3. Execute phases 1-5 according to priority order
4. Synthesize findings across all three designers
5. Report integrated conclusions with robustness validation

Estimated Time: 2-3 hours (with parallelization)
Computational Resources: 8 cores, 16 GB RAM
