# Ensemble Results: LOO Stacking

## Stacking Weights
- Skeptical model: 0.649
- Enthusiastic model: 0.351

## Ensemble Estimate
**mu_ensemble = 0.649 × 8.58 + 0.351 × 10.40 = 9.22**

## Interpretation
The ensemble combines both models weighted by their predictive performance (LOO). With only J=8 studies, LOO may be unreliable, but the close agreement between models (difference = 1.83) means the ensemble is similar to either individual model.

This ensemble estimate (9.22) is consistent with:
- Experiment 1: 9.87
- Experiment 2: 10.04

All evidence points to a population mean effect around **9-10 points**.
