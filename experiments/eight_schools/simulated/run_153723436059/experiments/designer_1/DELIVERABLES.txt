THREE MODEL CLASSES PROPOSED
=============================

Model 1: Standard Hierarchical (Partial Pooling)
- Hypothesis: Exchangeable effects, data-driven shrinkage
- Prior: tau ~ HalfCauchy(0, 25)
- Falsification: tau → 0 or extreme values

Model 2: Near-Complete Pooling (Homogeneity)
- Hypothesis: Effects essentially identical (I² = 1.6%)
- Prior: tau ~ Exponential(0.5) - strong regularization
- Falsification: Prior-posterior conflict (tau >> 0)

Model 3: Mixture Model (Latent Subgroups)
- Hypothesis: Hidden structure (K=2 components)
- Structure: Separate mu_k, tau_k for each component
- Falsification: Single component dominates (max pi > 0.85)

KEY DESIGN PRINCIPLES
=====================

1. Truth-seeking mindset (not task completion)
2. Explicit falsification criteria before seeing results
3. Adversarial stress tests for each model
4. EDA-informed competing hypotheses
5. Clear decision rules and stopping conditions
6. Alternative approaches documented

CRITICAL INSIGHT FROM EDA
==========================

Variance Paradox: Observed variance < expected
- I² = 1.6% (extremely low heterogeneity)
- Chi-square test p = 0.42 (no evidence against homogeneity)
- Variance ratio = 0.75

This challenges standard hierarchical modeling assumptions
and motivates all three model classes.

FALSIFICATION FRAMEWORK
=======================

Each model has clear "I will abandon this if..." criteria:
- Computational pathologies (divergences, poor ESS)
- Prior-posterior conflict
- Poor posterior predictive checks
- Extreme parameter values
- Model comparison strongly favors alternatives

EXPECTED OUTCOME (PREDICTION)
==============================

Most likely: Model 1 and Model 2 give similar results
- Small tau posterior (< 5)
- Substantial shrinkage toward common mean
- Near-complete pooling justified

Less likely: Model 3 discovers mixture structure
- Would be scientifically surprising
- No EDA evidence for this
- But worth testing to rule out

READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION
=========================

All specifications are implementation-ready:
- Stan/PyMC code structures provided
- Prior choices justified
- Computational settings specified
- Diagnostics checklist included

Estimated implementation time: ~30 minutes compute + analysis

STATUS: Design phase complete, awaiting implementation phase
