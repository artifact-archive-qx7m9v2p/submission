PRIOR PREDICTIVE CHECK - VERSION 2 SUMMARY
============================================

STATUS: CONDITIONAL PASS

REVISED PRIORS:
- μ ~ Beta(2, 18)         [unchanged from v1]
- κ ~ Gamma(1.5, 0.5)     [REVISED from Gamma(2, 0.1)]

KEY RESULTS:
- Prior φ range: [1.05, 95.70]
- Prior φ 90% interval: [1.13, 3.92]
- Observed φ range: [3.5, 5.1] ✓ COVERED
- Prior mass in observed φ range: 2.7%
- Prior mass in reasonable range [2, 10]: 17.5%

CRITICAL IMPROVEMENT FROM V1:
- v1: φ ≈ 1.05 (too concentrated, FAILED)
- v2: φ range up to 95.7 (covers observed, PASSED)

DECISION RATIONALE:
✓ Overdispersion coverage: PASS (v1 failed this)
✓ Prior predictive coverage: PASS (82.4% have range ≥ observed)
✓ No computational issues: PASS
⚠ Prior somewhat diffuse: ACCEPTABLE (weakly informative by design)

RECOMMENDATION: Proceed to simulation-based validation with these priors.
