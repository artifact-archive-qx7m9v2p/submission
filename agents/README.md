# Agents for Claude Code

## Setup

If you're using [Claude Code](https://docs.claude.com/en/docs/claude-code):

1. Rename the `orchestrator` file to `CLAUDE.md`
2. Copy the `subagents/` folder to `.claude/agents/` in your project root

Claude Code will automatically recognize and utilize the subagents as needed.
